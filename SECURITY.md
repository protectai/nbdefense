2. Send us an email at `security@protectai.com` with the following:  
    - The link to the issue you created above.
    - Your GitHub handle.

        - A description of what the vulnerability is.
        - Evidence of the issue happening or references to the relevant lines of code.

After we have reproduced the issue we will reply to the issue and [open a draft security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory) and will discuss the details there.

Once we've released a fix we will use the Security Advisory to announce the findings.
