## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is NB Defense?

Brought to you by Protect AI, NB Defense is a CLI tool and SDK that encourages you to think about security throughout every step of your machine learning development process. You can use nbdefense to scan for [Secrets](https://github.com/protectai/nbdefense/blob/main/docs/docs/supported-scans/detecting-secrets.md), [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://github.com/protectai/nbdefense/blob/main/docs/docs/supported-scans/detecting-PII.md), [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)](https://github.com/protectai/nbdefense/blob/main/docs/docs/supported-scans/detecting-CVEs.md), and [Licenses](https://github.com/protectai/nbdefense/blob/main/docs/docs/supported-scans/detecting-licenses.md) in your notebook and dependency files.
